                    <p>Morocco is located in the North-West of Africa. More than 80% of Morocco’s electricity is
                        generated using fossil fuels, while renewable energy accounted for nearly all of the remainder,
                        which was very little: wind 9%, hydroelectricity 5%, and solar 1%.</p>
                    <img src="img/d-img2.png" alt="#">
                    <p>The Moroccan government plans to reduce its dependence on foreign imports by developing renewable
                        energy, such as solar plants, to meet its domestic electricity needs.</p>

                    <p>Morocco’s Noor Power Plant is the largest concentrated solar power project in the world. It is
                        located in the city of Ouarzazate, in the district of Agadir, Morocco.</p>
                    <p>With the help of the German Federal Environment Ministry, 15 million euro will be spent on the
                        Noor Power Plant. The power plant will generate 370 gigawatts of electrical energy and reduce
                        CO2 emissions by 230 tonnes each year.</p>

                        the world. It will initially supply 650,000 local residents with solar electricity from dawn
                        until three hours after sunset.</p>
                    <p>By 2030, the percentage of installed electricity generation capacity based on renewable energies
                        is planned to reach 52%. In addition to solar energy, the country is also focusing on wind and
                        waterpower. That means that only 28% of electricity will come from fossil fuels instead of the
                        80% that the country is currently generating from fossil fuels.</p>

                                    below. That’s called direct current.</p>

                                    But with ten panels you can quickly save around 500 euros per year on your
