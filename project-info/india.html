    <p>The Netherlands can learn from this project, since it is an excellent way to supply all houses with enough
        solar power throughout the year. However, the Netherlands doesn’t have a lot of empty land, making it hard
        to install such a solar field.</p>

    <p>In order to tackle this problem, let’s take a look at the solar panel projects already in place. The number
        of households with solar panels continues to grow. Approximately 1.5 million households now have solar
        panels, compared to 1 million last year. According to the financial consultancy of Deloitte, the country has
        a total area of 892 square kilometers of potentially suitable roof surfaces.</p>

    <p>Currently, 35.7 square kilometers of those roofs are used for solar panels. They are on the right path but
        there is still a long way to go. First, they have to try to fill the total area of 892 square kilometers of
        suitable roof surfaces with solar panels, by making this choice financially interesting for its citizens).
        Second, they can try to form an alliance with other countries in Europe to make an international grid or
        join the International Solar Alliance.</p>
    <p>While the Netherlands lacks space for a solar field, the country has enough roofs for solar panels.</p>
