            <p>In 2004, only a few households had solar panels due to the installation costs of 1500 euros.</p>

            <p>In 2016, solar power broke through in the rental sector of houses. This is mainly due to social
                pressure and the ambitions from the Energy Agreement.</p>

            <p>The price of solar panels drops quickly due to better efficiency of solar panels and mass production
                in China. In 2012, a panel with a higher power yield cost 70 percent less than in 2008. At the end
                of 2012, there were suddenly 175,000 houses with solar panels.</p>

            <p>From 2020 onward, you can purchase solar panels with a cheap loan, which you repay partly from the
                amount you save on electricity. By the end of 2020, 1 million homes had solar panels.</p>

    <p class="deel-4">Currently, more than 36 million solar panels are installed in the Netherlands, on roofs or on the ground.</p>
