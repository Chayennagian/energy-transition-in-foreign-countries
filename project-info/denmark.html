    <p>The Netherlands is very similar to Denmark in terms of culture, country and climate. In the Netherlands,
        state control still appears to be lacking. We know where we want to go, but not which route weâ€™re going to
        take. Will it be all-electric, hydrogen or hybrid? Denmark developed a plan in 2005 to become more
        sustainable by 2025.</p>

    <p>To address this issue, we have to look at what the Netherlands already has. On land and at sea, we have 2.610
        wind turbines. The number of active wind power turbines in Denmark increased every year since 2011 and
        reached a total of 6.271 in 2021.</p>
    <p>The Netherlands can therefore install more wind turbines. According to the national government, the North Sea
        is a favorable place for offshore wind energy. The Netherlands could also build a wind farm instead of an
        island.</p>
